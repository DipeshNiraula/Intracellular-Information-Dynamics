# Intracellular-Information-Dynamics
A cellgraph structure for emmulating spatiotemporally resolved intracellular information flow. 

Copy CellGraph.py. Add empty folder named "plot". Run CellGraph.py.

## To Do: Update Plots

## Note 
RC: Local Current Clipped at 0 to forbide flow in negative direction. This limits applicaiton of RC to negative signal eg. cos. A min-max normalization must be applied.
