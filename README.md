## Intracellular Information Dynamics
A grid-graph based cellular reservoir model for emmulating spatiotemporally resolved intracellular information flow and for learning cellular response to extracellular ionic perturbation.

Create a folder named _plot_ in the working directory before running the codes. Run the codes in following sequence:
1. Intracellular_Information_Dynamics.py
2. Cellular_Decision_Making.py
3. Cellular_Decision_Making_Application.py
4. CellReservoir_Properties.py
